# üöÄ WARP INITIATION PROTOCOL [CODE-NAME: XTERMINATOR]

Greetings, Galactic Explorer! üåå

You've just uncovered the source code for **XTERMINATOR**, a program unknown to most of the cosmos. Before you even *think* about running this on your own machine, heed the warnings below ‚Äì for the consequences could be interstellar!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PILOTING PRECAUTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **DO NOT** run this program on your personal computer. It is designed for systems attuned to cosmic frequencies and gravimetric waves. Your Earth-bound PC will not handle it well! üõ∏
- Ensure that you fully understand the purpose and inner workings of **XTERMINATOR** before initiating it.
- Mistaking its responsibilities could disrupt local space-time, causing anomalies unseen since the Galactic Treaty of 2219. üìúüï∞Ô∏è

### SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
To safely initiate **XTERMINATORL**, your starship's mainframe should meet the following requirements:
- **Quantum Processor**: Capable of at least 42 Qubits.
- **Memory**: 100 Teraflops of available neural RAM.
- **OS**: GalacticOS 3.14 or above.

### ABOUT STARFALL
**STARFALL** is an experimental warp initiation protocol developed in the depths of the Andromeda Research Station. Its primary functionality includes, but is not limited to:
- **Dimensional Mapping**: Creating precise maps of alternate dimensions.
- **Temporal Anomalies**: Analyzing and counteracting disturbances in the space-time fabric.
- **Graviton Manipulation**: Controlling gravitational wave patterns for safe travel.

### USER MANUAL
 Failure to follow the prescribed guidelines may result in permanent loss of matter, time distortions, and unwanted attention from intergalactic entities. üëΩ

Remember, with great power, comes great responsibility. Handle **XTERMINATOR** with the same care as you would an unexplored galaxy. üåÄ

Happy piloting, and may the stars align in your favor!
